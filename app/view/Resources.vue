            <p>Simmons defines pacing as, "the rate at which instructional activities occur or at which specific
              'learning trials' are presented to the student."
              Too slow and students become bored and disengaged. Too fast and students may become confused and
              discouraged.
              He identifies <em>teacher</em> behaviors as one of the primary culprits of pacing problems.
            </p>
            <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-4 mb-2">Not all instructional time is created equal</h4>
            <p>
              Simmons cites a six year study deconstructing <em>academic learning time</em> into
              several variables, three of which are:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside pt-2 pb-2">
              <li>Allocated time</li>
              <li>Instructional time</li>
              <li>Engaged time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Simmons argues Engaged time, where students are putting forth cognitive effort and actively
              participating, should be maximized for optimal learning. </p>
            <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-4 mb-2">Allocation of time</h4>
            <p>
              Simmons identifies that written time allocations for propsed activies is often lacking, but critially important to gauge the true amount of time for a lesson.
              When a good estimate of the true amount of time is identified, identifying the primary Learning Target is next.
              A primary Learning Target clearly describes what you want students to know and be able to do by the end of the lesson.
              allocating time to activities that are most aligned with the lesson's primary learning target is the most important because it informs the educator on which activities should be
              prioritized and placed earlier in the lesson with enough time preferentially allocated.
            </p>
            <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-4 mb-2">Careful Questioning</h4>
            <p>
              Simmons points out that poorly scripted questions are a common cause of lost time in a lesson.
              Verbose, ambiguous, or nebulous questions introduce the possibility for time loss as the teacher tries to refine questions <em>during</em> instruction.
            </p>
            <h4 class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-4 mb-2">Assessments over Volume</h4>
            <p>
              Overloading a lesson at the cost of formative assesments is a big mistake according to Simmons.
              It undermines the importance of the primary learning objective by prioritizing time to less important objectives.
